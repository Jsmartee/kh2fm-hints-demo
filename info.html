    <h3 id="how_to">How To Use The Generator</h3>

    <h5 id="gen_hints">Generating Hints</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Select the pnach file you got from the randomizer generator website: <a href="https://randomizer.valaxor.com/">KH2FM Randomizer Generator</a></li>
        <li>You can select different categories of items to be included or excluded from the pool of important checks</li>
        <li>You can also choose to exclude certain worlds from having hints. This is here so that if you set a world to "Replace" on the randomizer website, you can opt out of getting a useless hint for that world.</li>
        <li>When all of the settings are the way you want, click "Generate Hints"</li>
        <li>When you collect a Secret Ansem Report in the game, select the world you found it in and click the corresponding button to reveal the hint</li>
        <li>You have 3 tries to select the correct world. The button will be disabled after the failed 3rd try</li>
    </ul>

    <h5 id="share_hints">Sharing Hints</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>If you and others are playing the same seed and want the same hints, click "Save Hints" and send the text file to everyone else playing the seed.</li>
        <li>If someone sent a hint text file to you, select that file and click "Upload Hints" to get the same hints they have.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5 id="track_hints">Tracking Hints</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Here are trackers to help track important checks you gather throughout the seed</li>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/TrevorLuckey/KH2Tracker">RedBuddha's Tracker</a></li>
                <ul>

            <li><a href="https://shinygoombah.github.io/KH2-Rando-Tracker/">TheShinyGoombah's Tracker</a></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Web based tracker</li>
                    <li>Paired together with a "normal" tracker</li>
                    <li>Other tracker includes total number of checks in each world</li>
                </ul>
            <li><a href="https://tracker.zaxu.xyz/next/">Zax's Tracker</a></li>

                </ul>
        </ul>
        <li>You can also use some of the trackers to view the hints instead of using the website:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>After generating hints, click "Save Hints" in the "Share Hints" section</li>
            <li>Load the text file into the tracker</li>
            <li>When you collect a report in the game, place it in the world you found it in and the tracker will display the hint and automatically update the tracker with the hint's information</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    </ul>

    <p>48 important checks by default. Adding Second Chance, Once More, and Promise Charm brings it up to 51.</p>

    <h5 id="worlds">Worlds/Locations</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Twilight Town</li>
        <li>Hollow Bastion</li>
        <li>Agrabah</li>
        <li>Beast's Castle</li>
        <li>Disney Castle</li>
        <li>Drive Forms</li>
        <li>Halloween Town</li>
        <li>Land of Dragons</li>
        <li>Olympus Coliseum</li>
        <li>Pride Lands</li>

        <li>Simulated Twilight Town (can be excluded)</li>
        <li>Atlantica (can be excluded)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>16 worlds by default. Adding Atlantica brings it up to 17.</p>

    <h5 id="general">General</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>The 3 Garden of Assemblage chests and the 7 Critical Bonus rewards are not included in any world.</li>
        <li>Disney Castle and Timeless River are combined into "Disney Castle".</li>
        <li>Cavern of Remembrance is considered part of "Hollow Bastion".</li>
        <li>Absent Silhouettes and Data Org members are included in their respective worlds.</li>
        <li>"Sora's Heart" refers to Level Ups.</li>
        <li>"Heartless Choice" refers to 0 important checks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5 id="logic">Logic</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>The worlds/locations with proofs will always be hinted.</li>
        <li>If a proof is from drive forms, all of the drive forms will be hinted.</li>
        <li>If a proof is in 100 Acre Wood, all of the torn pages will be hinted.</li>
        <li>If a proof is in Atlantica, all thunder and magnet spells will be hinted.</li>
        <li>If the above items are spread out across all 17 locations, the generator will follow this list (from highest to lowest priority):</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Proofs > Drive Forms > Torn Pages > Thunder > Magnet</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Reports pointing to proofs will be hinted.</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Ex: There's a proof in Port Royal. Report 4 points to Port Royal. Report 4 is in Halloween Town. Halloween Town must be hinted by another report.</li>
            <li>If the priority items above (proofs, forms, pages, and magic) are already taking up all 13 hints, they will be prioritized over these reports. </li>
            <li>Note: If the reports are on drive forms or in 100 Acre Wood, there is no logic to hint forms or pages as of now.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Items from the Garden of Assemblage chests or from Critical Extras are considered hinted.</li>
        <br>
        <li>For some examples demonstrating the logic, check this document: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DkiWHhR_Ki1oA0lxkxAb_3BDgHtdIqVJPSt8IvFYt1g/edit?usp=sharing">Logic Examples Doc</a></li>
    </ul>

    <h5 id="other">Other</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>The generator will prevent the hint pointing to Proof of Peace from being on Mushroom XIII.</li>
        <li>The generator will prevent the hint pointing to Proof of Connection from being on Terra.</li>
        <li>If Final Form is removed from the important checks pool, the generator will still hint it's location if there's a proof on drive forms.</li>
        <li>If a world is set to "Vanilla", none of its checks will be recognized by the program. 
            If that world is hinted, it will come up as a heartless choice and important items will not count towards number of important checks.
            Reports in worlds set to "Vanilla" will also not display hints as of now.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5 id="faq">FAQ</h5>
    <ul>
        <li><p><b>How do I get the hints in the game?</b></p>
            <p>The hints don't appear in the game. They are handled externally. You can view them through the website or through one of the important checks trackers.</p></li>

        <li><p><b>What counts as an important check?</b></p>
            <p>By default, 3 proofs, 5 drive forms, 4 summons, all 18 magic, 5 torn pages, and 13 ansem reports for a total of 48 important checks. Second Chance, Once More, and the Promise Charm can all be included as well. Final Form, Cure, Torn Pages, and Ansem Reports can be excluded from the pool.</p></li>
    
        <li><p><b>If Second Chance and Once More are on keyblades, do they count?</b></p>
            <p>If either of those abilities are on keyblades, they don't count towards any world's important checks total and they won't be hinted.</p></li>

        <li><p><b>What world do important checks in one of the 3 chests in GoA count for?</b></p>
            <p>They don't count for any world. If one of them is a hint, there's a GoA/Critical Extra option to view them.</p></li>

        <li><p><b>What world do critical extras given at the start of a Critical Mode seed count for?</b></p>
            <p>They don't count for any world. If one of them is a hint, there's a GoA/Critical Extra option to view them.</p></li>

        <li><p><b>What does "Sora's Heart" mean?</b></p>
            <p>"Sora's Heart" refers to level up rewards.</p></li>

        <li><p><b>What does "Heartless Choice" mean?</b></p>
            <p>"Heartless Choice" means that world has 0 important checks.</p></li>

        <li><p><b>Is Timeless River part of Disney Castle or its own seperate world?</b></p>
            <p>Timeless River is combined together with Disney Castle.</p></li>

        <li><p><b>Is Cavern of Remembrance part of Hollow Bastion or its own seperate world?</b></p>
            <p>Cavern of Remembrance is considered part of Hollow Bastion.</p></li>

        <li><p><b>Is Space Paranoids or 100 Acre Wood considered part of Hollow Bastion since they appear there in the vanilla game?</b></p>
            <p>No, Space Paranoids and 100 Acre Wood are each their own worlds.</p></li>

        <li><p><b>Everytime I upload the seed to the website, I get different hints. Is this normal?</b></p>
            <p>Yes, the important check numbers are still the same, but the generator shuffles them around each time. In order to guarantee you get the same hints, you need to save the hints
                and use the text file instead.
            </p></li>

        <li><p><b>Is there a tracker for important checks?</b></p>
            <p>Yes, you can use one the these trackers to help you track them: 
                <a href="https://jsmartee.github.io/kh2fm-hints-demo/info.html#track_hints">KH2 Important Checks Trackers</a></p></li>
