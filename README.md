# kh2fm-hints-demo

Bare bones hint generator for the Kingdom Hearts 2 Final Mix randomizer.
Based on SpikeVegeta's hint system where each Ansem Report is a hint that tells you how many important checks are in a world.

## How To Use
* Go to https://jsmartee.github.io/kh2fm-hints-demo/
* Select the pnach file you got from the randomizer generator website and click "Generate Hints".
* Option: You can select Torn Pages or Secret Ansem Reports to be excluded from the pool of important checks.
* Option: You can choose to exclude certain worlds from having hints. This is here so that if you set a world to "Replace" on the randomizer website, you can opt out of getting a useless hint for that world.
* If you and others are playing the same seed and want the same hints, click "Save Hints" and send the text file to everyone else playing the seed.
* If someone has sent a hint text file to you, select that file and click "Upload Hints" to get the same hints they have.
* You can also Download ZIP and open the index.html file to use it locally.
